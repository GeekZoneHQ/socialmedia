# VPSCheap (https://vpscheap.net/) do small VPS instances for $20 per year, which is perfectly fine for this.
# Other providers are available.

# You will need to have tweepy installed, which requires pip

# Also, yay python!

import tweepy # lets us tweet
import time # lets us use time
from random import uniform # lets us use a random float between two numbers

# Twitter authentication variables: Change *** to the strings provided at https://apps.twitter.com/
consumer_key = "***"
consumer_secret = "***"
access_token = "***"
access_token_secret = "***"

# Use twitter auth variables to set up access to twitter

auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

twitter = tweepy.API(auth)

# Line length must be less than 140 characters (obviously). Could check this programatically but meh.

# Read each line

# Total number of lines in file. Change before use. It would be more elegant to work this out programatically but meh

# Minimum integer of hours between tweets. Change before use.

# While the current line is less than the maximum line
while i < line_max:

    # Generate a random number between between the limits then multiply it by 3600 to get a value in seconds
    wait = uniform(rand_min, rand_max) * 3600

    # Show how long we will wait before sending the next tweet, converted to hours for readability
    print "Waiting for " + str(wait/3600) + " hours"

    # Wait that long. Sleep is not a great solution but we do not need to do anything else in this case so it will do.
    time.sleep(wait)

    # Send the tweet using the line we are currently on plus some other text
    twitter.update_status(lines[i] +  " Some other text ")

    # Show the line number that we just tweeted
    print "Tweet " + i + " sent"

    # Increase the line number counter by one
    i = i + 1
